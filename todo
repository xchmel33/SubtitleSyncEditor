✅ Auto align: find the longest sequence of similar subtitles by common durations and align them

Refactor subtitle align
- problem:
    - alignment is random, the reference subtitle is often not aligned
- solution:
    - instead of searching for subtitles close in time, mark the longest sequence of similar subtitles as aligned and re-time them to be matched
- current state of alignment process:
1. Method `alignAllSubtitles` returns index of 1st subtitle which is followed by the longest sequence of similar subtitles by common durations
2. Method `alignSignals` uses the index of subtitle returned by `alignAllSubtitles` as segment and aligns it to the other audio signal, returns offset
3. Method `_alignSubtitleTimes` re-times all subtitles returned as the longest sequence of similar subtitles by common durations
- refactor flow, names, add comments:
    MODULE: `align.js`
1. Main method fetching data and calling other methods called `alignBySubtitleSequence`
2. Change name of `alignAllSubtitles` to `findLongestSubtitleSequence`
3. Change name of `alignSignals` to `findSegmentOffset` (method removed, renamed `alignWavFiles` & kept in `correlate.js`)
4. Change name of `_alignSubtitle` to `reTimeSubtitles`
    MODULE: `correlate.js` (existing methods ending with `alignWavFiles`)
