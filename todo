1. Allow opening srt and vtt files for subtitles only
2. Allow opening mkv and mp4 files for videos only
3. Fix: File is saved to new files only after another opening of the same file dialog
4. Fix video loading issue:
    - run with no GPU support, if working make it dynamically switchable
    - make at least the development version work:
        - fix opening files
        - fix styles
