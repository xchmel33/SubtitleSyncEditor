## Description

Bachelors thesis project for the course **BIT** at **FIT VUT** in Brno.

This project is an implementation of a multi-platform tool designed for the simultaneous editing of subtitle files 
across several video versions. The application enables the concurrent creation and editing of subtitles for different 
variations of a single video, accommodating different cuts and inserted scenes. This feature addresses a significant 
challenge in subtitle editing. 

Key features of the application include:
- Spell checking
- Speech timing editing features

Additionally, the focus on user-friendliness and cross-platform compatibility ensures ease of use across common 
operating systems.
